# Progress over perfection: your first steps in accessibility

Accessibility is our responsibility as front-end developers, but it can be daunting to know where to start when you don’t have the budget or approval to dedicate time to it. The good news is that there are things you can do in your current workflow that will improve the experience for people with disabilities. In this talk, you will learn techniques you can apply when you’re writing code that will create an outsized impact: semantic HTML, when to use ARIA, and how to avoid common pitfalls (like unlabelled inputs and incorrect headings). Taking these small steps is how you start making meaningful progress towards a web for all.
